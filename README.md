# LARK Lab Reinforcement Learning Seminar

Join us for an engaging seminar hosted by the LARK Lab, where we explore the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare and beyond. This seminar will feature discussions on RL fundamentals, applications (with special focus on RL for Large Language Models and medical applications), and challenges. Whether you're new to RL or actively researching the field, this seminar provides a collaborative space to exchange ideas and insights. 

This biweekly seminar, each lasting 75 minutes, will cover key topics in reinforcement learning (RL), following a structured reading of selected chapters from a foundational RL textbook. We will explore both theoretical foundations and practical applications, with discussions on how RL intersects with **NLP and healthcare AI**.

## **Schedule and Readings** (Tentative)
The seminar will run **biweekly on Tuesday**, starting **March 18, 2025**. We will **skip the week of April 29** and conclude on **May 27, 2025**.

The reading materials will be based on Sutton & Barto (2020): Reinforcement learning [online book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). 

| **Date**        | **Topic**                                   | **Reading**                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **March 18**  | Introduction to Reinforcement Learning | Chapter 1 |
| **April 1**   | Multi-Armed Bandits | Chapter 2 |
| **April 15**  | Markov Decision Processes | Chapter 3 |
| **May 13**    | Dynamic Programming | Chapter 4 |
| **May 27**    | Monte Carlo Methods | Chapter 5 |

## **Format**
- **Presentation & Discussion**: A designated participant will give a brief summary of the reading, followed by an open discussion.
- **Applications & Examples**: We will explore real-world applications, including how RL is used in **AI-driven decision support systems**.
- **Hands-on Exploration** *(Optional)*: For those interested, we can discuss implementing key algorithms in Python.

## **Who Should Join?**
This seminar is open to **anyone interested in reinforcement learning**, whether you're new to RL or already working on related research. No prior RL experience is required, but familiarity with basic machine learning and deep learning concepts will be helpful.
